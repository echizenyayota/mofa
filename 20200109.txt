### A: 1:05 - 1:18

We are now deploying more and more complex missions and more and more challenging eviroments.That is where horiznotal engineering needs comment.

### B: 1:19 - 1:34

For peacekeeping to be operational,it of course, needs livable camps, possible road, functional air strips, and helpers to be able to operate.By the end of the next month, we would have already trained. Close to two hundred trainees.

### B: 1:34 - 1:39

Through working with Japanese trainers I learned a lot of things and am very very much happy for this course.

### C: 1:40 - 1:53

This contribution by Japan has paved the way for what I think was a pioneering project which brings to countries which have capability and countries which need capability toggether in support of  supporting peacekeeping.
